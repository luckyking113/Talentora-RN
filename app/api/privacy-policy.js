    detail:'Talentora Privacy Policy\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes how and when Talentora collects, uses, and shares your information\
when you use Talentora including our mobile applications and websites (the "Services"). Talentora\
receives your information through our mobile applications, websites, email notiﬁcations, and other\
interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection,\
transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this\
Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to use your information in,\
and as a result to transfer it to and store it in, your country and any other country where we\
operate. Privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the\
country where you live.\
Information Collection and Use\
Creating a Talentora Account and Proﬁle Information: When you create a Talentora account, you\
must provide access credentials either in the form of an email address and password or by\
authentication using another service, such as Facebook. You may optionally provide us with\
additional proﬁle information, including a short bio, location, and proﬁle picture. If you create your\
Talentora account by connecting through another service, we may use public information from that\
connected account to help complete your Talentora proﬁle. You may update or modify your proﬁle\
information and contact information at any time. Proﬁle information is available publicly on our\
Services, such as on your proﬁle page.\
Contact Information: In addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may\
use this information to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and\
facilitate your use of the Services. We may use the contact information (such as your phone\
number or email address) to help connect you with other Talentora users, even if that information is\
not publicly displayed. Some contact information like a veriﬁed phone number may be required in\
order to use certain Services.\
Finding Friends and Connecting to Other Services: Our Services include several features to\
help connect you to the accounts of people you already know. For example, you may upload\
information from your address book or connect your Talentora account to your account on another\
service such as Facebook. Talentora will match the information you provide with the contact\
information of other Talentora users in order to provide and improve the Services, for example by\
making recommendations and routing Talentora messages. You may remove address book data\
from Talentora at any time through the settings in your Talentora app. When you connect your\
Talentora account to other services, you are able to post your Content to those services as well.\
You may disconnect your Talentora account from your account on the other services at any time.\
Disconnecting your Talentora account will immediately revoke our authorization to cross-post on\
your behalf or otherwise access that account and we will delete information obtained from that\
connection (other than information that was publicly posted on Talentora, such as proﬁle\
information), which may take some time.\
Content, Following, and other Public Information: Talentora is a video sharing platform, so\
most of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public. This\
includes not only the Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it\
was posted, but also the accounts you follow, the Content that you like or comment on, and other\
public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated.\
For instance, your proﬁle information and public Content are immediately delivered to a wide range\
of users and other services that access Talentora. When you share information or Content via the\
Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.\
Location Information: In addition to proﬁle information, you may also tell us your exact location if\
you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. We may use\
and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as tagging a\
video with a location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with Content that\
has been tagged near your location.\n\nLinks: We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email\
notiﬁcations, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other\
means. We do this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising, and\
to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked\
on.\n\nCookies: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data\
and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as\
viewing public videos. A cookie is a small data ﬁle that is transferred to your computer\'s hard disk.\
Talentora may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you\
interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web trafﬁc routing on our\
Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept\
cookies. If you do not want cookies from Talentora or other websites, you can instruct your\
browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a\
cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you\
disable cookies.\n\nLog Data: Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the\
Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating\
system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application\
IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our\
Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services,view videos hosted by\
Talentora, or interact with our email notiﬁcations. Talentora uses Log Data to provide our Services\
and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log\
Data or remove any common account identiﬁers, such as your username, full IP address, or email\
address, after 18 months.\
Third-Party Services: Talentora uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services,\
including to host our various blogs and wikis and to help us understand the use of our Services.\
These third-party service providers may use cookies and other technologies to collect information\
about your use of our Services and other websites and services, including your IP address, device\
ID, pages viewed, and links clicked. Our service providers include Google Analytics and its\
demographics and interests reporting feature, which you can opt out of.\
Information Sharing and Disclosure\n\n​Our Consent: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you\
choose to publicly post a video or update your proﬁle information.\
Service Providers: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us\
in Singapore and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such servicee may preserve or\
disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law,\
regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or\
technical issues; or to protect Talentora’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy\
is intended to limit any legal defences or objections that you may have to a third party\'s, including a\
government\'s, request to disclose your information.\n\nBusiness Transfers: In the event that Talentora is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition,\                    reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that\
transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the\
new entity.\n\nNon-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private,\
aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user proﬁle information,\
public posts, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a\
particular link (even if only one did).\
Modifying Your Personal Information\
If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to\
access or modify the proﬁle information you provided to us and associated with your account.\
You can also permanently delete your Talentora account by contacting us.\
Our Policy Towards Children\
Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has\
provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us. We do not\
knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child\
under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and\
terminate the child\'s account.\
Changes to this PolicyWe may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make a change to this policy that, in our\
sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an email to the email address associated with your\
account or through the Services. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes\
become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.\n\nEffective: June 1, 2016'
